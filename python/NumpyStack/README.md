# NumpyStack
Some code snippets I wrote along while working through [The Lazy Programmer's](https://lazyprogrammer.me/) [NumPy Stack tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxgDUj5eygKnSd4MYHIuAC7E3VEPm_WLO) hoping to become a better<sup>\*</sup> data scientist. My background is .NET, C# and Java, I struggle(d) with Python already, okay??!?  

The course defines the Numpy Stack as some packages that are essential to implementing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms using Python. That name was chosen as all the other packages covered in the course, namely matplotlib, SciPy, and Pandas, are built on NumPy.
